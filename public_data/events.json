We will also be adding people to our super-amazing committee of gods/goddesses.\n\n------------------------ THE POTLUCK DEETS ------------------------\n\n-The requirement this week for admission is for you to bring any food which you identify with home. It can be a special (vegan(fied) please if possible!) dish which your family make, a national dish, a transnational dish, a sugary thing which makes you happy...\n\nOr, if you're uncomfortable with cooking but want to come you are still welcome- either bring a goody that reminds you of home (please Scottish people don't bring too much iron bru), or drop me a PM or e-mail us vegsoc@st-andrews.ac.uk. and we will team you up with someone for the cooking/sort something else out.\n\nThere will be cooking in the mansefield as always from 5:00.\nEating from 7:30pm.\n\nIn terms of ----------- ADMISSION TO THE COMMITTEE -----------\n\nIt is written into our constitution that we will always find a place for anyone who wants to get more involved with the society in our committee. So the only qualification you will need to get involved in committee fun times is membership (which can also be bought on the night!).\n\nIn terms of the important positions to fill.\nWe will be needing a new:\n\n- Secretary\n- Publicity Officer\n- Website Manager\n- Ticketing officer (role tbc at the meeting)\n\nThese roles can also be split between people which to give you an idea could in part look something like:\n\n- weekly e-mailer\n- Recipe blog maintainer\n- general e-mail organiser\n- coding boss\n\nWe of course always need general helpers (we can think up better names :P) who do the standard vegsoc thang.\n\nThe standard vegsoc thang basic requirements:\n\nTo get on with committeeing, you'll need to be able to:\n\n- Drink Tea and eat food with the rest of the committee on occasion. Generally to enjoy good vibes and spread ethical fun-times. **\n- Cook (at least on occasion, but hopefully weekly) for our events.*\n- Wash-Up with us after events (when the need arises, which is strangely rarely these days...).\n- Put up with sarcastic chat from the rest of the committee.\n\nIf you would like to get involed but can't make it- that's a-ok. Just PM me or e-mail vegsoc@st-andrews.ac.uk with your ideas if you just want to give us your ideas, or get in contact with your intention to join up (and ideas) if you'd like to get more involved with the committee.\n\n------------------------------- Crisis What Crisis? ------------------------------------------\n\nWe'll also be chatting about the future of veg soc, and where we want to go with the society. If you don't want to get into the whole committee shindig, but do want to say something about the society/ideas for our future directions you are very very welcome to just turn up.\n\n--------------------------------      TIMINGS      -----------------------------------\nNew Elections shouldn't last longer than 12 minutes in total (I just made that number up but I feel it's accurate) - Making up new committee position names for people may take longer, but can be done in the background later...\n\nWe'll then get onto VegSoc's existential questions- which will hopefully make up a decent, but not boringly long ammount of our foody chat, followed by a chilled out general chat time afterwards.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* You don't already have to be a good cook. I didn't know what I was doing when I joined vegsoc. Genuinely. One of my old profile pictures is me burning pizza in Andrew Melville.

Our main aim is to connect students from different degrees and years of study and empower them to share knowledge on interesting topics, allowing them to pursue personal projects and compete in hackathons using skills and tools that are not normally taught at St Andrews, or expected to be self-learned. The events will be between 1-2 hours long on weekday evenings and drinks and pizza will be provided."},{"id":"1017441608288146","name":"GamingSoc Pocket Edition","longitude":-2.7975338,"latitude":56.3416901,"date":"Thu Oct 08 20:00:00 BST 2015","description":"Hi folks,\n\nThanks to everyone that turned up for Nintendo Night, it was an amazing turnout and it was great to see so many people enjoying themselves!\n\nAnyway, this week we're back at Rascal's Bar for our second sub-event!
